This is a build environment for building Hass.io Docker images and is
capable of building Docker images for multiple architectures.

Note: _This build environment is **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL**! It still needs
a lot of testing, and the documentation is far from complete. Use at your
own risk!_

## Usage

The whole build environment is based on Docker and is placed into
a single Docker image. This makes this version portable and removes the
need for "large" and complicated Bash scripts (as provided by Home Assistant).

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged \
    -v ~/.docker:/root/.docker \
    -v "$(pwd)":/docker \
    hassioaddons/build-env:latest \
    [options]
```

Adding `-v ~/.docker:/root/.docker` shares your Docker hub credentials with
the built environment. This line may be omitted in case you don't want to
push your image.

Adding `-v "$(pwd)":/docker` shares your current working directory as the
directory to start the build process from. This line MUST be omitted in case
you are building from a remote repository.

The `[options]` can be replaced by one or more of the following options:

```txt
Options:

    -h, --help
        Display this help and exit.

    -t, --target <directory>
        The target directory containing the Dockerfile to build.
        Defaults to the current working directory (.).

    -r, --repository <url>
        Build using a remote repository.
        Note: use --target to specify a subdirectory within the repository.

    -b, --branch <name>
        When using a remote repository, build this branch.
        Defaults to master.

    ------ Build Architectures ------

    --aarch64
        Build for aarch64 (arm 64 bits) architecture.

    --amd64
        Build for amd64 (intel/amd 64 bits) architecture.

    --armhf
        Build for armhf (arm 32 bits) architecture.

    --i386
        Build for i386 (intel/amd 32 bits) architecture.

    -a, --all
        Build for all architectures.
        Same as --aarch64 --amd64 --armhf --i386.
        If a limited set of supported architectures is defined in
        a configuration file, that list is still honored when using
        this flag.

    ------ Build base images ------

    These build options will override any value in your 'build.json' file.

    --aarch64-from <image>
        Use a custom base image when building for aarch64.
        e.g. --aarch64-image "homeassistant/aarch64-base".
        Note: This overrides the --from flag for this architecture.

    --amd64-from <image>
        Use a custom base image when building for amd64.
        e.g. --amd64-image "homeassistant/amd64-base".
        Note: This overrides the --from flag for this architecture.

    --armhf-from <image>
        Use a custom base image when building for armhf.
        e.g. --armhf-image "homeassistant/armhf-base".
        Note: This overrides the --from flag for this architecture.

    --i386-from <image>
        Use a custom base image when building for i386.
        e.g. --i386-image "homeassistant/i386-image".
        Note: This overrides the --from flag for this architecture.

    -f, --from <image>
        Use a custom base image when building.
        Use '{arch}' as a placeholder for the architecture name.
        e.g., --from "homeassistant/{arch}-base"

    ------ Build output ------

    -i, --image <image>
        Specify a name for the output image.
        In case of building an add-on, this will override the name
        as set in the add-on configuration file. Use '{arch}' as an
        placeholder for the architecture name.
        e.g., --image "myname/{arch}-myaddon"

    -l, --tag-latest
        Tag Docker build as latest.
        Note: This is automatically done when on the latest Git tag AND
              using the --git flag.

    --tag-test
        Tag Docker build as test.
        Note: This is automatically done when using the --git flag.

    -p, --push
        Upload the resulting build to Docker hub.

    ------ Build options ------

    --arg <key> <value>
        Pass additional build arguments into the Docker build.
        This option can be repeated for multiple key/value pairs.

    -c, --no-cache
        Disable build from cache.

    --parallel
        Parallelize builds. Build all requested architectures in parallel.
        While this speeds up the process tremendously, it is, however, more
        prone to errors caused by system resources.

    --squash
        Squash the layers of the resulting image to the parent image, and
        still allows for base image reuse. Use with care; you can not use the
        image for caching after squashing!
        Note: This feature is still marked "Experimental" by Docker.

    ------ Build meta data ------

    -g, --git
        Use Git for version tags instead of the add-on configuration file.
        It also manages 'latest' and 'test' tags.
        Note: This will ONLY work when your Git repository only contains
              a single add-on or other Docker container!

    -n, --name <name>
        Name or title of the thing that is being built.

    -d, --description <description>
        Description of the thing that is being built.

    --vendor <vendor>
        The name of the vendor providing the thing that is being built.

    -m, --maintainer, --author <author>
        Name of the maintainer. MUST be in "My Name <email@example.com>" format.
        e.g., "Franck Nijhof <frenck@addons.community>"

    -u, --url <ur>
        URL to the homepage of the thing that is built.
        Note: When building add-ons; this will override the setting from
              the configuration file.

    -c, --doc-url <url>
        URL to the documentation of the thing that is built.
        When omitted, the value of --url will be used.

    --git-url <url>
        The URL to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
        When omitted, the value is detected using Git or the add-on url
        configuration value will be used.

    -o, --override
        Always override Docker labels.
        The normal behavior of the builder is to only add a label when it is
        not found in the Dockerfile. This flag enforces to override all label
        values.

```

## Examples

### Building a local add-on

The following example will build a local add-on and push it onto Docker hub.

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged \
    -v ~/.docker:/root/.docker \
    -v "$(pwd)":/docker \
    hassioaddons/build-env:latest \
    --target addon-slug \
    --tag-latest \
    --push \
    --all
```

### Building from a remote GitHub repository

The following example will build the `example` add-on. It will build it for
all architectures supported by that add-on.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged --name build \
    hassioaddons/build-env:latest \
    --repository https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-example \
    --target example \
    --git \
    --all
```
